&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <h1 >Tasks</h1>
<h4>
<ol>
<li>Create and initialize a new firestore for the BusyBuy app and include it inside the project.
</li>
<li>Create a register page that allows new users to register into your app.</li>
<li>Create a login page that allows existing users to login into your app</li>
<li>Create a home page to display a list of products. The home page should include a feature to search products by name.</li>
<li>Create a cart page to display the products that the user has added to the cart.</li>
<li>Create a product card component that displays the image, title, price, and a button to add or remove that specific product from the cart. If the product is already in the cart, its quantity should be increased.</li>
<li>The product card should only render the increase and decrease buttons if the product is on the cart page</li>
<li>Create an orders page to display the products the user has purchased and the order date.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can add the following functionality to the project to maximize your score:
    <ul>
    <li>Create a sidebar to filter the products based on product price and categories on the HomePage. The search and filter should be applied to the products simultaneously.
</li>
    <li>Add conditional rendering to show the absence of data and loading state using the react-spinners library.</li>
    <li>Show toast messages for async actions and error conditions using the react-toastify library.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

</ol>
</h4>
<hr>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <h1 >Hints</h1>
<h4>
<p>Use separate contexts to manage the user authentication state and product state. For example, the authentication state may have actions for handling login success, logout, setting the error message, etc.</p>
<p>Create a function that can apply both search and filters at the same time. The function should have distinct logic for filtering based on category, price range, and search terms.</p>
<p>The additional task of the BuyBusy app uses the following third-party components:

-  react-spinners: A simple React spinner library. It can display a circular loader when fetching data from the database. Learn more: <a href="https://github.com/icarus-sullivan/react-spinner-material#readme">link</a> 
-  react-toastify: Allows you to add notifications to your app with ease. It can display the status of network requests and other async actions as a toast. Learn more: <a href="https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/">link
</a>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <h1 >API Structure</h1>
<h4>
The firebase API would look like this:
<br>
  - /products to store the products 
<br>
  - /usersCarts/<user_uid>/myCart to keep the cart products and their quantity.
  <br>

  - /userOrders/<user_uid>/orders to hold users orders.
